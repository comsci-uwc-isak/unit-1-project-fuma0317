Planning
----------
** Defining the problem (Topic 1.1.1)**
100-150 words explaining the context of the problem

I felt before we make this app, we should identify what does "simple based program". I mean to what extent should it be simple.   Unless we identify the world, programmer might be struggling how to simplify the code.

Secondable, when you correct the trip history with the place name, the data probably become wrong because in the case that customers uses a ferry to go across the ocean and park your car on it, the distance might be diffrent from actual one.

Third, if you want to make the file deletable, you should make a autmatical back-up system which automatically save the data after you edit it.
