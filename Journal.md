Reflection
Today, I identified the input and output of various program and list up the steps which shows how I make this app step by step
And also, I saw the expalanation of car rental.
What I learned is that how to indentify the input and output and I felt this process is really important before you make a program.  I learned that steps should be understandable for people wh don't know how to code.
