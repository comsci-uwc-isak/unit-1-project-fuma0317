Today, I identified the input and output of various program and list up the steps which shows how I make this app step by step
And also, I saw the expalanation of car rental.
What I learned is that how to indentify the input and output and I felt this process is really important before you make a program.  I learned that steps should be understandable for people wh don't know how to code.

#installation program
#!/bin/bash

#This file creates the folder structure for the
#minimal Car Rental App

echo "Starting the installation"
echo "Press Enter"

read

#moving to the desired location
echo "moving to desktop"

#Check for correct change directory
cd ~/Desktop

#Create App folder
mkdir RentalCarApp
cd RentalCarApp

#Create folder for database and scripts
mkdir db
mkdir scripts
echo "structure created successfully"
